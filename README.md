# Belly_Button_Dashboard
### Created a dashboard with a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart using Plotly.js for belly button bacterial data. The dashboard charts display bacterial cultures collected from a single individual volunteer's belly button. Hovering over the bars or bubbles will provide the otu_lables (a.k.a the bacterial culture names) for the otu_id. The demographic information for the individual volunteer is displayed as well. A navigation pane was added with links to other webpages with extra background information. D3 and Bootstrap 3 were used in conjunction with JavaScript and Plotly library to create this dashboard. The index.html file must be opened with a Live Server from VS Code.
